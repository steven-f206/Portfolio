            <p>My name is Steven Ferreira. I'm a Brazilian American and very proud of my heritiage. I attended Gwinnett Technical College along with my wife, 
                and intended to get a degree in computer science, however neither of us were making enough money to support each other and school, so I dropped
                out and got a job working at a car dealership. It paid the bills and then some, but it never gave me the career fulfilment I always wanted. It
                wasn't until six years later that i heard about GT's coding bootcamp. I decided to enroll, and the rest is history.</p>

            <p>I love computers and, more specifically, I love to code.</p> 
            
            <p>Knowing that I will be able to help shape the technological world is amazing! I can only hope I will make a big enough impact on the world and 
                make my sons proud.</p>
